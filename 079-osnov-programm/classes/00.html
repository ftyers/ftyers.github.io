<h2> Class 1 </h2>

<p>On this page you will find a lot of commands, commands are instructions for your computer. You
can use them to tell your computer what to do. You will recognise commands because
they are prefixed with a dollar sign <tt>$</tt>. It is not necessary to type the dollar in order
to issue the command. </p>

<p>In order to give commands to your computer you need to open up a terminal (also called "shell",
"console" and a number of other things). It will be called "Terminal" or "Терминаль". To open it,
double click the icon. Or find it in the menu system.</p>

<p>Commands generally have the following basic form: A short mostly vowel-less sequence of letters
followed by a <span title="прабил"><u>space</u></span> and then the arguments to the command.</p>

<h3> Working with the virtual machine </h3>

Start with updating the virtual machine:

<pre>
$ sudo apt-get update
</pre>

It will ask you for a password. The password is the same as the username. Note 
that when you type the password you won't see anything on the console. Just keep
typing and when you are finished press return ⏎.

<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install git
</pre>

This will install <tt>git</tt>. It will ask you if you want to continue. You need
to type <tt>Y</tt> and then press return ⏎.

<h3> Checking out your repository </h3>

First check out your repository, replace <tt>XXXXXX</tt> with your username on GitHub.

<pre>
$ git clone https://github.com/XXXXXX/2017-osnov-programm.git
</pre>

Change directory into the repository you just cloned:

<pre>
$ cd 2017-osnov-programm
</pre>

And make three <span title="каталогы, папки"><u>directories</u></span>:

<pre>
$ mkdir corpus project homework
</pre>

The <tt>corpus</tt> directory will store your corpus so you don't lose it. The <tt>project</tt>
directory will be for your project work and the <tt>homework</tt> directory is for any 
homework you need to submit that isn't related to classwork.

<pre>
$ touch corpus/README.md project/README.md homework/README.md
</pre>

This <tt>touch</tt> command makes a new empty file called <tt>README.md</tt> in each of the
directories. We need to do this because <tt>git</tt> does not allow us to add empty directories.

<pre>
$ git add corpus project homework
</pre>

Here we add the directories that we have created to our <tt>git</tt> repository.

Note that now you might need to do something extra like set your email address:

<pre>
$ git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
</pre>

Where <tt>email@example.com</tt> is your email address and <tt>Your Name</tt> is your name.

Then run the command:

<pre>
$ git commit -a -m "Initialise stuff"
</pre>

And this "commits" them. Any time you make a change in your repository you should commit
the change. You should get the following output:

<pre>
$ git commit -a -m "stuff"
[master 03e817a] stuff
 3 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 corpus/README.md
 create mode 100644 homework/README.md
 create mode 100644 project/README.md
</pre>

<pre>
$ git push
</pre>

When you push, you send your local changes to the GitHub server. You will need to enter 
your username and password.


<h3> Navigating directories </h3>

When you download something on the virtual machine, it will often go in a subdirectory
of your home directory called something like <tt>Downloads</tt> (or <tt>Baixades</tt> if your
computer is in Catalan). To find that directory in the terminal you can try the following commands

<pre>
$ pwd
</pre>

This tells you which is your current location in the file system. The letters <tt>pwd</tt> stand
for "present working directory". If you are in <tt>2017-osnov-programm</tt> you probably want to start
to look in your home directory. So type:

<pre>
$ cd ..
</pre>

The <tt>cd</tt> command stands for "change directory". This particular command will take you 
one directory up in the hierarchy. Now do <tt>ls</tt> which stands for "list". You will see
a list of contents in your home directory. In order to change to the <tt>Downloads</tt> directory
run the following command:

<pre>
$ cd Downloads
</pre>

Now do <tt>ls</tt> again and see what you have there. If you have a file called <tt>WikiExtractor.py</tt>
and a file that ends with <tt>-pages-articles.xml.bz2</tt> then you can proceed to the next step. Otherwise
you need to make sure you downloaded those two files in your web browser.

<h3> Extracting your corpus </h3>

You can follow the <a href="http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/WikiExtractor">instructions</a> to extract 
your corpus. When it is extracted you will have a file called <tt>wiki.txt</tt>

<h3> Adding your corpus to <tt>git</tt> </h3>

First check how big the corpus is. If it's more than a 2-3M then you want to make
a smaller corpus.

You can check how big the corpus is using the command:

<pre>
$ ls -lh wiki.txt 
-rw-r--r-- 1 fran fran 634K set  2 13:07 wiki.txt
</pre>

The <tt>-lh</tt> means list the files in long form and with their size in human-readable form. This
file is of a reasonable size. This one would not be:

<pre>
$ ls -lh wiki.txt 
-rw-r--r-- 1 fran fran 3,3G nov 12  2014 wiki.txt
</pre>

If your <tt>wiki.txt</tt> file is too big you can make a smaller version by taking the top 100,000 lines.
The command to do that is:

<pre>
$ head -n 100000 wiki.txt > wiki.100k.txt
</pre>

This will make a new file with only 100,000 lines called <tt>wiki.100k.txt</tt>. Check how big it is:

<pre>
$ ls -lh wiki.100k.txt 
-rw-r--r-- 1 fran fran 40M set 12 22:04 wiki.100k.txt
</pre>

If it's still to big (40M is still to big) then try 10,000 lines:

<pre>
$ head -n 10000 wiki.txt > wiki.10k.txt
</pre>

This looks fine, 5.4M is doable:

<pre>
$ ls -lh wiki.10k.txt 
-rw-r--r-- 1 fran fran 5,4M set 12 22:04 wiki.10k.txt
</pre>

Now once you've made a reasonable size file you can add it to your repository. First
 you need to copy the file to the directory <tt>2017-osnov-programm/corpus</tt>. You can
do this either on the command line with the <tt>cp</tt> command or using the graphical
user interface. Then:

<pre>
$ cd ../2017-osnov-programm/corpus
</pre>

To change directory back to your repository, and:

<pre>
$ git add wiki.txt
$ git commit -a -m "add wiki corpus"
</pre>

To add the file and commit it and

<pre>
$ git push
</pre>

To push it to the GitHub server.
