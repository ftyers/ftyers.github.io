<h2> Class 4 / 1</h2>

<h3> The <tt>dict</tt> datastructure </h3>

The <tt>dict</tt> datastructure is a way of storing a mapping from a key, for example <em>a</em> to
a value, for example <em>b</em>. 

<pre>
>>> map = {}
>>> map['a'] = 'b'
>>> map
{'a': 'b'}
>>> map['a']
'b'
</pre>

We can also check if a key is in the map.

<pre>
>>> 'a' in map
True
>>> 'b' in map
False
>>> 'c' in map
False
</pre>

What could we possibly use that for ? Well, one application could be for making a frequency list. 
Let's assume that we're processing the output from our tokeniser. The input stream looks like:

<pre>
1       Это     _       _       _       _       _       _       _       _
2       течение _       _       _       _       _       _       _       _
3       следует _       _       _       _       _       _       _       _
...
</pre>

So, what would the general algorithm be ? First read line by line, check if the line has 
ten columns. If the line has ten columns then take the second column and see if it is in the 
map. If it is not in the map, add it to the map with the counter value <tt>0</tt>. Then increment
the counter.

<pre>
import sys

vocab = {} # dict to store frequency list

# for each of the lines of input
for line in sys.stdin.readlines(): 
	# if there is no tab character, skip the line
	if '\t' not in line:
		continue
	# make a list of the cells in the row
	row = line.split('\t')
	# if there are not 10 cells, skip the line
	if len(row) != 10:
		continue
	# the form is the value of the second cell
	form = row[1]
	# if we haven't seen it yet, set the frequency count to 0
	if form not in vocab:
		vocab[form] = 0
	vocab[form] = vocab[form] + 1

# print out the frequency list
for w in vocab:
	print('%d\t%s' % (vocab[w], w))
</pre>

<p>You'll note that the code does not print out the frequency list in order. Which Unix
command might you use to sort the output in frequency order ? </p>

<p>If you want to sort your frequency list in Python, there are a number of ways to do 
it. You can search on the internet for "python3 sort a dict by value" and there are 
some good one liners, but they introduce a lot of new syntax. So, I'm going to suggest 
that you do it like this. The <tt>dict</tt> datastructure is not sortable, so we need
to change it to something that is, for example the <tt>list</tt> datastructure.</p>

<pre>
freq = []

for w in vocab:
	freq.append((vocab[w], w))

freq.sort(reverse=True)
</pre>

This code takes the <tt>dict</tt> and puts it in a list of value:key tuples. For example,
if we print out the top-5 items in the list:

<pre>
print(freq[0:4])
</pre>

After running the code on the SynTagRus corpus We would get:

<pre>
[(70049, ','), (45598, '.'), (22727, 'в'), (21083, 'и')]
</pre>

What do you think we would get if we set the argument <tt>reverse</tt> to <tt>False</tt> ?

<!--<h3> Integers and floats </h3>-->

<h3> File input/output </h3>

<p>Files... if you're like me, you probably have too many of them. As programmers
we need to store stuff in files so we don't clutter up our programs with lots of data. 
For example, let's say we want to store the frequency list that we've made above 
in a file instead of outputting it to standard output.</p>

<pre>
fd = open('freq.txt', 'w+')
for w in vocab:
	fd.write('%d\t%s' % (vocab[w], w))
fd.close()	
</pre>

<p>The <tt>open()</tt> function opens a file, it has two arguments, the name of the file
and the way to open it. We used <tt>w+</tt> which means "open the file in write mode
and overwrite the file if it already exists otherwise create it". There are other modes,
such as read-only or append mode. </p>

<p>Now we've stored the frequency list in the file, let's try loading it and doing something
interesting. We're going to read the sorted file and then give each token a rank in addition to 
its frequency. </p>

First read in the file:

<pre>
import sys

freq = []

fd = open('freq.txt', 'r')
for line in fd.readlines():
	line = line.strip('\n')
	(f, w) = line.split('\t')
	freq.append((int(f), w))
</pre>

<p>This gives us a list of tuples of frequency and word form. Notice that we used <tt>int()</tt> to convert
the input string to an integer. And how we used the <tt>(f, w) = line.split('\t')</tt> to change the 
return type of <tt>split()</tt> to a tuple instead of a list.</p>

<p>We can use the algorithm below to find the rank of a word in the <em>sorted</em> frequency list. You loop through the list
keeping track of the lowest frequency you have seen in the variable <tt>min</tt> and the current rank in the 
variable <tt>rank</tt>. Any time you see a frequency lower than the last lowest one you've seen, you increase
the rank and set the last lowest to the one you just saw. </p>
	
<pre>
rank = 1
min = freq[0][0]
ranks = []
for i in range(0, len(freq)): 
	if freq[i][0] < min: 
		rank = rank + 1
		min = freq[i][0]
	ranks.append((rank, freq[i][0], freq[i][1]))
</pre>

Now create a script called <tt>rank.py</tt> which takes a command line argument and reads in a frequency list from a file 
and outputs a ranked frequency list (either to a file or to standard output). Do you notice anything interesting 
in the data ? Do you think you could make the code more efficient ? (hint: we are looping through the data
twice)

<h3> Transliterator </h3>

<p>
The idea of a transliterator is to take a string written in one writing system and transliterate
it to another. For example, let's take the output from our tokeniser. We can all read Cyrillic, but 
imagine if the text was in a writing system that wasn't so easy to read. It might be useful to have
a transliteration of the string. 
</p>
<pre>
# sent_id = 1
# text = Это течение следует на север до Японского побережья, оказывая заметное влияние на климат японского побережья.

</pre>

We can use the <tt>MISC</tt> (Miscellaneous) column for storing the transliteration, 

<pre>
# sent_id = 1
# text = Это течение следует на север до Японского побережья, оказывая заметное влияние на климат японского побережья.

</pre>

<p>If the language you are working on is already written in Latin, then there are two options, the first
would be to convert it into a Cyrillic transcription. Alternatively you could convert it into a rough
approximation of IPA.</p>

<p>Your transliteration/transcription table should be stored in a file that is loaded before use. The file
format could look like:</p>

<pre>
а	a
б	b
в	v
...
</pre>

That is, two columns, separated by a tab <tt>\t</tt> character. The program should be called <tt><b>transliterate.py</b></tt>

<h3> Questions </h3>

<ul>
  <li> What to do with ambiguous letters ? For example, Cyrillic `е' could be either <em>je</em> or <em>e</em>.</li>
  <li> Can you think of a way that you could provide mappings from many characters to one character ? </li>
  <ul>
    <li> For example <em>sh</em> → ш or <em>дж</em> → c ? </li>
  </ul>
  <li> How might you make different mapping rules for characters at the beginning or end of the string ? </li>
</ul>
