<h3>Why make a finite-state transducer?</h3>

<h3>A simple lexical transducer</h3>

The most basic lexical transducer can be made with a Multichar_Symbols definition and a Root lexicon. These
are two parts that are necessary for the transducer to compile. In the Multichar_Symbols section we 
define our grammatical tags that we are going to use, and we can use the Root lexicon to store a few lexemes.
For example,

<pre>
Multichar_Symbols

%<n%>                ! Имя существительное

LEXICON Root

хула%<n%>:хула # ; ! "город"
</pre>

In Multichar_Symbols we define a grammatical tag for noun and leave a comment (the part after the ! symbol) to indicate
what the symbol stands for. Tags can take any form, but my preference is for grammatical tags to appear
between less than < and greater than > symbols. The Multichar_Symbols section ends when the first 
LEXICON appears. Other things that go in the Multichar_Symbols section include archiphonemes and helper symbols 
for the phonological rules (often called "diacritic symbols" in the literature).

The remainder of the transducer is made up of a set of "continuation lexica", these have unique names and
are prefixed with the line "LEXICON". These lexica are read from Root and may call each other, including 
recursively. There is a special lexicon which is pre-defined and called "#" which indicates the end of the 
string. 

There are two sides which are separated by a semicolon. These two sides may be referred to 
in different ways in the literature. Get used to working out which side is being referred to. This is 
complicated by the fact that some ways of referring to them are ambiguous:

* left side, upper side, lexical side, lower side
* right side, lower side, morphotactic side, upper side, surface side

I will try and be consistent and use the following:

* lexical form/side, to refer to the lemma + tags
* morphotactic form/side, to refer to the stem + suffixes
* surface form/side, to refer to the final surface form

So, now we've gone through that explanation, let's try compiling our lexicon file. You should open a new file
with your favourite text editor and type in the code above. Save it as <tt>chv.lexc</tt> in a new directory and navigate there 
on the command line. Give the following command:

<pre>
$ hfst-lexc chv.lexc -o chv.lexc.hfst
</pre>

This command says to use the HFST lexc compiler to convert the lexicon file, <tt>chv.lexc</tt> into a binary 
representation and store the output in <tt>chv.lexc.hfst</tt>. The command should give the following output:

<pre>
hfst-lexc: warning: Defaulting to OpenFst tropical type
Root...
</pre>

and you should get a file called <tt>chv.lexc.hfst</tt>:
<pre>
$ ls -l chv.lexc.hfst 
-rw-r--r-- 1 fran fran 491 des  3 19:57 chv.lexc.hfst
</pre>

As we didn't tell the compiler what kind of transducer we wanted to produce it has defaulted to OpenFst (a backend
transducer library) and the tropical weight transducer (a way of distributing weights over an FST).

There are a few things we need to get used to doing with the lexical transducer. The first is printing it out,
we can do this in a couple of ways. First we can print out the strings that the transducer covers, using 
the <tt>hfst-fst2strings</tt> command,

<pre>
$ hfst-fst2strings chv.lexc.hfst 
хула<n>:хула
</pre>

Our fairly limited transducer only recognises one string pair so far. We can also print out the FST that was produced:

<pre>
$ hfst-fst2txt chv.lexc.hfst 
0	1	х	х	0.000000
1	2	у	у	0.000000
2	3	л	л	0.000000
3	4	а	а	0.000000
4	5	<n>	@0@	0.000000
5	0.000000
</pre>

Here the first column is the input state, the second column is the output state, the third and fourth columns 
are the input and output symbols respectively and the fifth column is the weight of the transition. The @0@ is 
the default symbol for epsilon &mdash; that is no input/output and final states have only two columns
the first being the state id and the second being the weight.

As you can imagine it is fairly easy to write a program to turn this tabular format into a format appropriate for
visualising with GraphViz or some other graph visualisation library. Feel free to write your own visualisation
method using your preferred library, or use this one I prepared earlier:

<pre>
import sys

print('digraph G {')
for line in sys.stdin.readlines():
	line = line.strip()
	row = line.split('\t')
	if len(row) >= 4:
		print('%s [label="%s"];' % (row[0], row[0]))
		print('%s -> %s [label="%s:%s"];' % (row[0], row[1], row[2], row[3]))
	elif len(row) == 2: # Final state
		print('%s [label="%s"];' % (row[0], row[0]))

print('}')
</pre>

You can save it in a file called <tt>fst2dot.py</tt> and run it as follows:
<pre>
$ hfst-fst2txt chv.lexc.hfst | python3 fst2dot.py  | dot -Tpng -ochv.lexc.png
</pre>

Being able to visualise the transducer and see which strings it accepts is vital for being
able to debug your code. Finally, go back to your <tt>chv.lexc</tt> file and add some more 
stems, for example <em>пахча</em> "сад, garden", <em>урам</em> "улица, street" 
and <em>канаш</em> "союз, union". Then recompile and rerun the other steps up to 
visualisation.

<h3>Morphotactics</h3>

The morphotactics of a language is the way that morphemes combine to make surface forms. If you
are one of those people that believes in morphemes then you probably also believe that they
can be combined and that there are language-specific constraints on their combination, for example 
in Russian if the plural locative morpheme is -ах then you should have городах and not *ахгород.

<h4>Continuation classes</h4>

In finite-state transducers the the morphotactic ordering constraints are implemented by means
of continuation classes. These are sets of suffixes which can appear in the same position. For 
example let's imagine a simplified Chuvash noun with a stem, a plural suffix
and a case suffix. We might build up a model of Chuvash inflectional morphology for nouns as follows:

STEM + (PLURAL)? + CASE

That is, a stem, followed optionally by a plural
suffix and finally an obligatory case suffix (if we consider 0 to be a case suffix, let's assume
that we do for now).

It would also be possible to express this in table form:

    урам<n><nom> :  урам 
    урам<n><gen> :  урамӑн 
    урам<n><dat> :  урама 
    урам<n><loc> :  урамта
    урам<n><abl> :  урамтан
    урам<n><ins> :  урампа 
    урам<n><pl><nom> :  урамсем 
    урам<n><pl><gen> :  урамсен 
    урам<n><pl><dat> :  урамсене 
    урам<n><pl><loc> :  урамсенче 
    урам<n><pl><abl> :  урамсенчен 
    урам<n><pl><ins> :  урамсемпе 

So, from this table we can see that there are a number of suffixes that we can group into 
three main groups: case suffixes in the singular, plural suffix and case suffixes in the 
plural. We could then proceed to build up a series of continuation classes by taking the 
longest substring from left to right,

<pre>
Multichar_Symbols 

%<n%>                ! Имя существительное

! Define your multicharacter symbols here.

%>                   ! Граница морфемы

LEXICON Root

Nouns ;

LEXICON CASE-SG 

%<nom%>: # ;
%<gen%>:%>ӑн # ;
%<dat%>:%>а # ;
%<loc%>:%>та # ;
%<abl%>:%>тан # ;
%<ins%>:%>па # ;

LEXICON CASE-PL

%<gen%>: # ;
%<dat%>:%>е # ;
%<loc%>:%>че # ;
%<abl%>:%>чен # ;
%<ins%>:%>пе # ;

LEXICON PLURAL

CASE-SG ; 
%<pl%>%<nom%>:%>сем # ; 
%<pl%>:%>сен CASE-PL ; 

LEXICON N

%<n%>: PLURAL ;

LEXICON Nouns

урам:урам N ; ! "улица"
</pre>

The greater than symbol, >, indicates the morpheme boundary, we put this between
morphemes to indicate to the phonological rules where the morpheme boundaries are. This is 
because often phonological changes happen at morpheme boundaries so it's useful to know 
where they are. In addition they can be used to produce an FST that can be used for 
morphological segmentation.

In the above code I have left a comment indicating where to define your multicharacter
symbols. About 50% of all bugs you will find when developing FSTs will be related to 
not defining multicharacter symbols or tags. The reason being that some tools automatically
determine them and some don't, so you might not immediately see the effects of not defining
them until your processing reaches a tool that does. To get an idea of what the problem 
might be, try making two new files called <tt>good.lexc</tt> and <tt>bad.lexc</tt>:

In <tt>good.lexc</tt> put, 

<pre>
Multichar_Symbols 

%<n%>                ! Имя существительное
%<nom%>              ! Именительный падеж

LEXICON Root

хула%<n%>%<nom%>:хула # ;
</pre>

And in <tt>bad.lexc</tt> put,

<pre>
Multichar_Symbols 

%<n%>                ! Имя существительное

LEXICON Root

хула%<n%>%<nom%>:хула # ;
</pre>

Now run the following commands to compile them and print out the transducers.

<pre>
$ hfst-lexc good.lexc | hfst-fst2txt 
hfst-lexc: warning: Defaulting to OpenFst tropical type
Root...
0	1	х	х	0.000000
1	2	у	у	0.000000
2	3	л	л	0.000000
3	4	а	а	0.000000
4	5	<n>	@0@	0.000000
5	6	<nom>	@0@	0.000000
6	0.000000

$ hfst-lexc bad.lexc | hfst-fst2txt 
hfst-lexc: warning: Defaulting to OpenFst tropical type
Root...
0	1	х	х	0.000000
1	2	у	у	0.000000
2	3	л	л	0.000000
3	4	а	а	0.000000
4	5	<n>	@0@	0.000000
5	6	<	@0@	0.000000
6	7	n	@0@	0.000000
7	8	o	@0@	0.000000
8	9	m	@0@	0.000000
9	10	>	@0@	0.000000
10	0.000000
</pre>

As you can see with <tt>bad.lexc</tt> the tag <nom> is treated as normal character symbols, which means
that it might not be treated as a tag by other programs. Fortunately it's possible to write a nice 
script to sanity check our lexicon:

<pre>
IN=$1 # Input file
HEAD=`grep -nH 'LEXICON Root' $IN  | cut -f2 -d':'` # Find the limit of the header
# For each of the symbols we find in the whole file 
for i in `cat $IN | grep -o '%<[^>]\+%>' | sort -u`; do 
	# Run through the header and see if it is there
	cat $IN | head -n $HEAD | grep "$i" | wc -l | sed "s/$/\t$i/g" | grep "^0"; 
done 
</pre>

You can save this in a file called something like <tt>validate.sh</tt> and run it like,

<pre>
$ sh validate.sh chv.lexc
0	%<abl%>
0	%<dat%>
0	%<gen%>
0	%<ins%>
0	%<loc%>
0	%<nom%>
0	%<pl%>
</pre>

And it will show you which tags you have forgotten to define.

Ok, so now we've defined all our tags and added our continuation classes we can look at 
the output of our transducer.

<pre>
$ hfst-lexc chv.lexc | hfst-fst2strings 
hfst-lexc: warning: Defaulting to OpenFst tropical type

</pre>

Now, this doesn't look half bad, but as linguists we might feel like complaining about
a couple of things in terms of the representation:

* We have different continuation classes for singular and plural case affixes, but
   they look like they could be treated as a single class
* The concatenation of some case suffixes with vowel stems doesn't look like it's 
/   going to produce the right form. 

Problem (2) is more serious &mdash; we'll come to that shortly, but problem (1) is more
philosophical and deserves some thinking about. As linguists
we would like the most elegant, linguistically-motivated solution. But as engineers
we would like something that works. If a solution is inelegant but solves the problem
should it immediately be discarded? And the counter-question, if an elegant solution
is possible and doesn't require substantially more engineering work, should it be discarded?

These are the kind of tradeoffs that need to be taken into account when designing and developing a morphological
transducer. We are trying to optimise two things, simplicity of representation (engineering) and beauty of 
representation (linguistics). The answers will not always be easy and the answers will almost 
never be given to us.

<h4>Archiphonemes</h4>

So, we've got to the point where we have modelled part of the morphology of the language
in a fairly brute-force way. Let's revisit our decisions and see if we can figure out 
some ways of making better ones. 

First of all, those case suffixes look pretty similar, 
	
nom	-	-
gen	-ӑн	-н
dat	-а	-е
loc	-та	-че
abl	-тан	-чен
ins	-па	-пе

If we look at a Chuvash grammar, or happen to have heard anything about Chuvash we might be aware
that Chuvash has vowel harmony, which is a process whereby in principle vowels with the 
same feature should go together. For example back vowels should go with back vowels 
and front vowels should go with front vowels. So, we might posit the following rule,

* The instrumental suffix is -пV, where the vowel V is either а or е depending on the 
    backness of the vowel in the previous syllable.

We might also look at the locative and ablative suffixes and think that a possible rule
for these suffixes would be,

* The т in the locative and ablative turns to a ч after a nasal.
