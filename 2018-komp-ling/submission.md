# Submitting Assessments

<div style="column-width:30em">

## General

Visit the [website repo on
Github](https://github.com/ftyers/ftyers.github.io) and use the Github
web interface to fork (requires a github account). Clone your fork.

All your work will be submitted by committing files in the
`2018-komp-ling` folder, and then pushing to your github account. Make
then a "pull-request" using the github web interface; this registers
your submission.

## Practicals

At the end of each practical, write a short report in [TeX][tex] or
[CommonMark][commonmark] responding to all the prompts from the
practical.

The report should be in the `2018-komp-ling/practicals` folder with
the basename `$practical-response`. So for the practical
`segmentation.html`, responses should be named
`segmentation-response.tex` or `segmentation-response.md`.

If the practical prompts request you to submit code or other
materials, include it in a folder `$practical/` inside the
`practicals` folder. So you will include your maxmatch implementation
inside a folder `2018-komp-ling/practicals/segmentation/`.

## Quizzes

For each quiz, answer the questions in a file `$quiz-response.md` or
`$quiz-response.tex`.

If the quiz prompts request you to include additional materials (code,
graphics, etc), include them in a `$quiz` folder. For example, if you
create an image `fst.jpeg` for quiz-01, include it as
`2018-komp-ling/quizzes/quiz-01/fst.jpeg`.
