\section{Implementation of maxmatch and description of its performance}
My maxmatch has been implemented as python function which get line to be tokenized as a variable. The algo logic is recursive iteration from the whole line to the first symbol in its beginning. When we find symbol/s which is/are in our pre-compiled dictionary we add this compiled element to tokenized list and recursively call the same function but with the line without parsed element. \newline

If there is no any word inside the line in question matching any word inside the dictionary, we assume that the first symbol in the line should be parsed as a separate unit. We append this unit to our tokenized list and recursively call maxmatch with the line shortened by the first symbol

\section{Instructions }
We need to open the file using "with" operator. iterate over each line and run our maxmatch function with it. The results can be appended to the list.
