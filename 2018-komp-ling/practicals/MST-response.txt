In the folder, the file kernelarray.py implements the Chi-Edwards algorithm. The file needs a conllu UDPipe segmented file as the input and will output a list of heads with their dependents for every head, for every sentence. To input the file, open the .py file and change the file address in the main section (still not good enough in coding to implement args, sorry.)
