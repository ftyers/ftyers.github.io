Output (first 10 lines) from running the [script](https://github.com/Veranchos/ftyers.github.io/blob/master/2018-komp-ling/practicals/Practical%203/palindrome.py) for finding palindromes 
on the freq.txt file from the previous practical:

## Implementing n dimensional matrices with dict

I implemented the code from the task and got this output:
```
	a	absorbed	all	and	another
бы	0	0	0	0	0	
вас	0	0	0	0	0	
видит	0	0	0	0	0	
всего	0	0	0	0	0	
вы	0	0	0	0	0	
```
>Why do we need end='' passed to the print() statement ? What would happen if we didn't have it?

We need ```end=''``` to avoid printing every new element at the new line, because ```\n``` is the default ending.
Without this ending we have this table:
```
	a	absorbed	all	and	another
бы	
0	
0	
0	
0	
0	

вас	
0	
0	
0	
0	
0	

видит	
0	
0	
0	
0	
0	

всего	
0	
0	
0	
0	
0	

вы	
0	
0	
0	
0	
0	

```
After saving [this](https://github.com/Veranchos/ftyers.github.io/blob/master/2018-komp-ling/practicals/Practical%203/args.py) code and running it in the command line using
```$ python3 args.py a b c ```

I had this output:
```['args.py', 'a', 'b', 'c']```
-- it's the list of arguments passed to the command line.

## Unigram language model
Here is my code [train.py](https://github.com/Veranchos/ftyers.github.io/blob/master/2018-komp-ling/practicals/Practical%203/train.py) It runs from command line and takes two arguments: 1)path to the input file and 2)path to the output file. Mine are [test.txt](https://github.com/Veranchos/ftyers.github.io/blob/master/2018-komp-ling/practicals/Practical%203/test.txt) [res.txt](https://github.com/Veranchos/ftyers.github.io/blob/master/2018-komp-ling/practicals/Practical%203/res.txt) resp. Test file was downloaded from [Russian data from the SynTagRus corpus](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Russian-SynTagRus/blob/master/ru_syntagrus-ud-test.conllu)
``` 
$ python3 train.py test.txt res.txt
```
>What might be a simple improvement to the language model for languages with orthographic case ?

I think, this simple improvement might be a wordform lemmatization: we could count not only wordforms but the lemmas, which could say us more about the context.
