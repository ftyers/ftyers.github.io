## Report on tokenisation task

I wrote a python script in order to implement maxmatch algorithm (maxmatch.py). *You will understand easily how to use it once you run the file*

I extracted japanese dictionary as well as training sentences (via python, again). I chose WER to test my code, and it showed 14%.
