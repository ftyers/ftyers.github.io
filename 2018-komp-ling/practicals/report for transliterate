This program transliterates Russian text into Latin letters. Simply name the
text you want to transliterate 'text' and put it under the same directory
as the python file. Then run the python.

If the original Russian text does not differentiate ё from e,
the program will not either, for differentiation requires a huge Russian 
dictionary to run the spelling check, which we do not have so far.

This program, however, will fix the result to match the pronounciations for 
some common and simple words. For example, её, ого and его will be turned 
into the correct transliteration based on their pronounciations.

Since ого and его will be located at the end of words but not the end
of sentences, if there is a space right after them, we are confident
changing the г into v according to the pronounciation.

The hard sign in Russian Ъ is silent, so the transliteration process simply
deletes it.

The dictionary upon which the transliteration is based is included in the 
python file.
