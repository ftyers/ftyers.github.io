This is my realization of the MaxMatch algorithm.

To run this program, please put the python file, test.txt and dict.txt in the same folder.
Then enter $python3 the_address/maxmatch.py$.

The dict.txt is the 2nd column of the train.conllu file. The test.txt is the 2nd column of the test.conllu file.
Both of them will be further processed by the python program.

The Hypothesis.txt file included is the output of tokenized sentences, and the ref.txt is the tokenization extracted from the test.conllu file.

WER gives a score of 0.91%, which indicates a high accuracy of the maxmatch algorithm.

The errors are mostly names of places, people, academical disciplines, etc.. When one phrase is composed of 2 phrases and one of the 2 is not in the dictionary, the tokenization of the big phrase is also considered an error.
