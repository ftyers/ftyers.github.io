I downloaded the Italian UDPipe model (italian-isdt-ud-2.2-conll18-180430), and parsed an article from Wired.it (https://www.wired.it/economia/start-up/2019/03/26/plastica-bicchieri-pcup/). Every paragraph was separated by a newline.
The model has been loaded and tested on the article with success. It is possible to find the result in paragraph.conllu, the command was the following one: "cat testarticle.txt | udpipe italian-isdt-ud-2.2-conll18-180430.udpipe --tokenize --tag --parse > paragraph.conllu".
To run xrenner, did not checkout the develop git as it was causing a 7/11 error in testing mode.
Tested the english mode with the example file and worked generally good, a couple of examples of disambiguation problems were the UK flag assimilated to the new New Zealand  flag and having the word "Flag" in Consitution Project corefered with current flag.
The english model did not corefered anything in italian language.
Main change rule to use italian in the configuration file (config.ini): opening marks for speech â€œ, added regexes for italian definite and indefinite articles, changed number separator.
The rules added that actually worked were:
#"che" matches name before
text=/^[Cc]he$/;pos=/NOUN/&anytext&anyagree&takefirst;1;nopropagate
#prefer reflexive to corefer to previous noun
text=/^[Ss]i$/&func!="expl:pass";pos=/(NOUN|PROPN)/&anytext&anyagree;1;nopropagate
added also propagate entity type across apposition, that made possible to tag "anche a i cosiddetti prodotti monouso  : piatti  , bicchieri  , stoviglie e altri accessori" as corefered.
Relative and reflexive pronouns are marked sufficiently well: 9/13 are correct. The first occurence of "che" is not recognized, as absence of punctuation lets UDPipe think that startup is a conj of head "usa", while "usa e getta" should be treated as a collocation and Pcup be the head of next sentence.
the result file is udx.html and in the folder "udx" is possible to find the language model used.
