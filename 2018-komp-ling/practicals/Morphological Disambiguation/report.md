# Practical 3 - Morphological disambiguation

1. **Tagger Comparison**

For tagging, I used Polish corpus. The algorithms I used: UDPipe, MarMoT

UDPipe results are in ```UDPipe\_result.txt```, MarMoT results are in ```MarMoT\_result.txt```.
MarMoT was qutie tricky to use and result tags are rather strange. For tagging I used a pre-trained model pl.marmot

I hope it is the correct tagging.

2. **Constraint Grammar**
