 # Finite-state morphology & Transliteration

## Finite-state morphology
Subdirectory `fsmorphology` contains all the stuff I made `hfst` to produce. I was lucky to reach _Evaluation_ stage.

## Transliteration

This is [repository](https://github.com/yaskevich/webtools/) of transliteration tool which does scientific (not practical) transliteration for Belarusian and Russian. It's written in JavaScript and available as a web-service at [Philology.BY](https://tools.philology.by/). Maybe, it is only tool of this purpose for these languages presented in Internet. I coded it at request of my colleague.
