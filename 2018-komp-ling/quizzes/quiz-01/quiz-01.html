<h1>Quiz 1</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Which problems does maxmatch suffer from? (Choose all that
apply.)</p>
<p>a) requires comprehensive dictionary</p>
<p>b) is computationally expensive</p>
<p>c) is difficult to program</p>
<p>d) constructs non-grammatical sentences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write a perl/sed substitution with regular expressions that
adds whitespace for segmentation around &quot;/&quot; in &quot;either/or&quot;
expressions but not around fractions &quot;1/2&quot;:</p>
<pre><code> &quot;either/or&quot; -&gt; &quot;either / or&quot;
 &quot;1/2&quot;       -&gt; &quot;1/2&quot;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>the text mentions several times that machine learning
techniques produce better segmentation than rule-based
systems; what are some downsides of machine learning
techniques compared to rule-based?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>write a sentence (in English or in Russian) which maxmatch
segments incorrectly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what are problems for sentence segmentation? provide one
example in English or Russian for each that applies.</p>
<p>a) ambiguous abbrevations with punctuation</p>
<p>b) sentences containing symbols '!' and '?'</p>
<p>c) sentences lacking separating punctuation</p>
<p>d) sentences not separated by whitespace</p>
