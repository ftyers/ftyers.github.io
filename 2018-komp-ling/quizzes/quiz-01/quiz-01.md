# Quiz 1

1. Which problems does maxmatch suffer from? (Choose all that
   apply.)

      a) requires comprehensive dictionary
   
      b) is computationally expensive
   
      c) is difficult to program
   
      d) constructs non-grammatical sentences

2. Write a perl/sed substitution with regular expressions that
   adds whitespace for segmentation around "/" in "either/or"
   expressions but not around fractions "1/2":

        "either/or" -> "either / or"
        "1/2"       -> "1/2"

3. the text mentions several times that machine learning
   techniques produce better segmentation than rule-based
   systems; what are some downsides of machine learning
   techniques compared to rule-based?

4. write a sentence (in English or in Russian) which maxmatch
   segments incorrectly.

5. what are problems for sentence segmentation? provide one
   example in English or Russian for each that applies.

      a) ambiguous abbrevations with punctuation

      b) sentences containing symbols '!' and '?'

      c) sentences lacking separating punctuation

      d) sentences not separated by whitespace
