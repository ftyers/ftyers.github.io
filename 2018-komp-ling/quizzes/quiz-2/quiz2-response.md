# Quiz 2 by Nikolaeva Anna

1. See fst1.jpg. 

2. Examples:
- geese's → geese is (incorrect)
- Cate's house → Cate is house (incorrect)
- Cate's already done her homework → Cate is already gone (incorrect, must be "Cate has already done")

For fixings the mistakes of the second and third type, we should look at the morphological disambiguation or even syntax level, and that, as far as I understand, cannot be done within FSTs or it is rather elaborate. 

But maybe we can deal with the first type of mistakes (geese's → geese is). Apparently we should make some changes on the morphotactic side of our transducer in a way that we expand "'s" only when it goes after a noun in a singular form. 

3. a, b, c 
4. 
a) To my mind, it's not possible to rewrite rewrite rules into parallel two-level rules without changing them, as in FSTs there is not only input (lexical) level, but also a surface level, so there will always be the difference in a way the rule looks like (in two-level rules there is a ":" used to show the transducer from lexical side to surface, and two-level rules have more operators, than rewrite rules). For example, for the following two rewrite rules, which convert the lexical string 'kaNpan' to the surface string 'kamman', :  
```
(a)	N -> m / _ p; elsewhere, n.
(b)	p -> m / m _
```
the two-level rules will look like that:
```
(a)	N:m <=>    _ p:
(b)	p:m <=> :m _
```
They look similar, but in the first case 'p' and 'm' on the right belong only to the input level, and in the second case 'p:' belongs to the input level and ':m'belongs to the output (surface) level, and exactly that allows us to apply these rules parallelly to get the right output. 

b) We can use underspecification to rewrite rewrite rules into parallel two-level rules. For example, we can apply the following rewrite rules according to their order to get the output of the Finnish genitive 'maku' (taste) as 'maun', but the genitive of 'puku' (dress) as 'puvun':
```
(a)	k -> v / u _ u C (C) #
(b)	k -> ∅ / V _ V C (С) #
```
But we cannot rewrite them into two-level rules as: 
```
(a)	k:v <=> u _ u C [#: | C]
(b)	k:[epsilon] <= V _ V C [#: | C],	
```
because they will get in conflict with one another. But we can use a symbol "|" (the logic "or") to make a correspondence part of the rule broader in the second rule (to "underspecify" the rule):
```
(a)	k:v <=> u _ u C [#: | C]	
(b)	k:[epsilon] | k:v <= V _ V C [#: | C]	
```
Also we can use archiphonemes to underspecify rules, as they can stand in for several surface symbols.   For example, if we have archiphoneme "Ă" (= the surface "ӑ" or "e"), the following rule combines two rewrite rules at once: "Ă" becomes "ӑ" after back vowels and "Ă" becomes "e" in all other cases:
```
"Back vowel harmony for archiphoneme {Ă}"
%{Ă%}:ӑ <=> BackVow: _ ; 
```

c) I don't understand the meaning of subtracting the context of the more general rule from the more specific. 
For example, the rewrite rule from the answer (b) 
```
k -> v / u _ u C (C) # 
```
is already specific. In two-level rules we cannot write anything like 
```
k:[epsilon]  <=> [u - V] _ [u - V] C [#: | C]	
```
in order to get 'maun' from 'maku', but 'puvun' from 'puku'.  [u - V] seems to be nonsence. 

d) Theoretically we may subtract the context of the more specific rule from the more general rule to make the general two-level rule more specific, but it is not an optimal solution. We can try to rewrite the rewrite rules from the answer (b) as:
```
k:[epsilon] <=	[V - u]	_	[V - u] C [#: | C]
       		    [V - u]	_	u C [#: | C]
       		    u	_	[V - u] C [#: | C]
```
But it looks complicated. In this case we may always resort to underspecification to make two-level rules simplier. 

Or maybe we can use the 'except' syntax in a twol file to subtract the context of the specific rule, that contradicts to our general rule. 

5. See fst2.jpg. I have tried to draw it as I understand it. "?" stands for all other cases not included in SOFT. 
My code can be seen in plural.py. It will work with input as in nouns.txt.
