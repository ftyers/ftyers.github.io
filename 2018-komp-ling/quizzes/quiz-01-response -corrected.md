<br /> 2. sed 's/\([^0-9]\+\)\/\([^0-9]\+\)/\1 \/ \2/g' <br />
<br /> 3. ML is barely interpretable and applicable only to a particular dataset while the rules can be applied to several types of data and can help to manipulate the result more conciously. <br />
<br /> 4. I guess it could be something like Damneducation! - Damned u cat ion! <br />
<br /> 5. <br /> a) I think that ambiguous abbrevations are even more so if they are followed by a word with an upper case, e.g. Bill had a tough life. <br />

<br />c) It can probably happen in informal speech, social networks texts.<br />
<br />d) The only thing I can think about is when reading a pdf file where spaces dissapear.<br />
