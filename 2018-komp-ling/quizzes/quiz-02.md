 I suppose it will expand "s" in all the words it sees it but it's not what we want. 
Probably we want to change "s" into "is" only in the cases where "s" is a contraction for "is" like in the phrase
"he's smart". In this case we can change our rule, for example, into <img src="./isnew.png" width="500" height="40">
