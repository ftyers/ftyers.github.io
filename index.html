<h3> Description </h3>
<p>
This course is an introduction to the pipeline approach to natural language processing. In a pipeline
approach, raw text goes through a sequence of steps (or tasks) to process it into a form more useful
for end-user applications. The steps we will cover are sentence segmentation, word tokenisation, 
morphological analysis and disambiguation and dependency parsing. This should give you all of the 
details you need in order to approach more complex tasks such as co-reference resolution, relation
extraction, etc.
</p>
<h3> Course objectives </h3>

By the end of this course you should be:
<ul>
<li> Understand issues in segmentation and tokenisation of texts and implement solutions </li>
<li> Use two-level morphology to model morphological phenomena </li>
<li> Describe and use three approaches to morphological disambiguation </li>
<li> Understand the principles behind transition-based and graph-based dependency parsing </li>
<li> Know the steps to be able to go from raw text to dependency trees for any language </li>
</ul>

<h3> Prior experience </h3>
<p>
You are expected to have knowledge of programming in Python and some experience with Unix-based operating 
systems. In addition you should be comfortable with using popular search engines to answer simple
questions about other programming languages and operating-system based issues. 
</p>
<p>
You need not have any experience in natural language processing.

<h3>Marking</h3>

<ul>
<li>60% Practicals</li>
<li>20% Exam</li>
<li>10% Tests</li>
<li>10% Active participation</li>
</ul>

<p>
<!--<p>
<b>Exam:</b> There will be a short exam to test you on what you have learnt in the course. There will be a number of 
  multiple choice questions and a programming assignment to complete on paper. As programming is a subject that is 
  more suited to practical evaluation the exam has a concomitantly low contribution to your final mark.
</p>-->
<p>
<b>Practicals:</b> Most of the course will be made up of practical sessions. Practical sessions will take up
all of the allotted time and you will be expected to finish them as homework. They should be submitted a day
before the date of the next practical session <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe">Anywhere on Earth</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Exam:</b>  There will be an end of course exam which will consist of ten questions. The exam will be a take home
exam.
</p>
<p>
<b>Tests:</b> Each class will have a test attached to it. The test will consist of up to 10 questions which you will
be expected to answer and return before the subsequent class. Submission of these tests will be done by forking
using <tt>git</tt>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Active participation:</b> Beyond simply showing up, I encourage you to contribute to discussions by 
asking questions, answering questions, making relevant comments, helping classmates and asking for help with in-class 
activities, etc. There are no stupid questions &mdash; I want to make sure everyone grasps the concepts, and many 
are not as straightforward as they may first seem (or as I think they are). You are also expected to have read 
any assigned readings before class.
</p>

<h3>In the classroom</h3>

<!--<p>
This course is taught mostly on computers, so we will be using computers in every class. This 
brings about the potential for a number of distractions, so please use the computer 
only for relevant classroom activities. In other words, please refrain from any 
non-class-related activities, including messaging (e-mail, social media, etc.), homework 
for other courses, etc.
</p>-->
<p>
Note on pronouns: If you'd like to be referred to by a pronoun that you think we might not
guess correctly or if you notice us referring to you by some other pronoun than what you'd prefer, 
please let me know so that we can get it right.
</p>
<p>
Note on language: If we are talking too fast, or if we use an expression that you do not understand
and you think it is having an effect on your learning, please ask us to slow down. You are 
welcome to come and talk to us at any time about issues relating to language. We will be happy 
to discuss them.
